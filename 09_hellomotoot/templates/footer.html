    <p style="font-size: 10px;">Made quite quickly by <a href="https://icosahedron.website/@halcy">@halcy</a> using <a href="https://github.com/halcy/Mastodon.py">Mastodon.py</a>, a library I (still @halcy) maintain &middot; If you actually use this and want it to not shut down because twilio trial account cash ran out, consider throwing some money at me: <a href="https://ko-fi.com/h4lcy">ko-fi.com/h4lcy</a>.</p>
    <p style="font-size: 10px;">privacy statement: I store the data I need to store to provide the service, and none besides. Data goes through twilio for SMS processing where needed, and their processing of the data is subject to their privacy statement. This app is quite hacky - don't expect security best practices. Service is best-effort. Please don't break it - I <emph>will</emph> cry. I will not look at your data except to fix things when they break. I will delete your data if you ask me to (lorenzd@gmail.com). <a href="https://github.com/halcy/hellomotoot">source code</a></p>
